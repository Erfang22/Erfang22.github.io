# You need to remove windows now !

When we talk about oprating system, it will get important for us to have a secure os but that's not the case for a closed source software like windows.

The porblem is that you can't see the code that is running on that os but when you use linux you always know that what is happening on your system right now !

soo with that set, Let's get to the point that what THE HECK is GNU/linux ? 

I consider it as a kernel with GNU license that distros take linux kernel and add GNU tool's and other things, for windows you usually have a version like windows 7 or windows 10

distro does not mean that way.Distro is a flavor of the GNU/Linux kernel.(for more information you can visit distrowatch website).

If i want to say that which linux distros are best for begginers, this is my list :

1.Mint 

2.Ubuntu

3.EndeavourOS

4.Pop!_OS

5.KDE neon

6.Arch Linux (for someone who wants to learn linux)

you can go and search about them yourself and for the next post Im going to cover the whole Arch Linux install and after that i will go for the desktop, cuz Arch Linux

does not come with a graphical installer like the others and you need to install evrything youself.Thats why its harder then other distros.

Have a good night or a good day.... I'll see you in the next post !
